Electric Vehicles Data Analysis using Tableau Dashboard

Electric vehicles (EVs) are rapidly gaining popularity as a sustainable alternative to traditional gasoline-powered cars. This project analyzes EV adoption trends in the U.S. using a Tableau dashboard, offering insights into market growth, vehicle efficiency, and geographical distribution. The study includes both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) to provide a comprehensive view of the EV landscape.

Key Insights from the Analysis

1. Growth in EV Adoption: The number of electric vehicles has grown rapidly since 2015, with a sharp increase in recent years. This can be attributed to technological advancements, cost reductions, and government incentives.
2. Dominance of BEVs Over PHEVs: BEVs make up 77.6% of total EVs, indicating a clear consumer preference for fully electric vehicles over hybrid alternatives.
3. Teslaâ€™s Market Leadership: Tesla dominates the EV market, accounting for a majority of vehicles. The Model Y and Model 3 are the most popular models, showing strong brand loyalty and consumer trust.
4. Geographical Trends: States like California have significantly higher EV adoption rates, likely due to state incentives, infrastructure investments, and consumer awareness.
5. Range Limitations: The average electric range is 67.83 miles, highlighting the need for continued advancements in battery technology to improve EV usability.
6. Incentive Awareness Gap: A large portion of EVs have unknown CAFV eligibility, indicating potential gaps in public awareness regarding government incentives.
